### Summary

[Jyve](http://www.jyve.com/) is an application that faclitates merchandize inspection for food and bevarage industries. Clients which own big brands such as Gatorade want to make sure their product looks good and is well stocked on stores all over the country. Jyve provides an on-demand labor to fulfill the client's tasks.

During a period of three days I was tasked to come up with a prototype to allow clients and coordinators to view past and current tasks.

### Goal

- Provide a tool for administrators and coordinators to plan and manage tasks.

- Shows at a glance the “status” of the jobs in the system at a given period/window in time.

- Allow to filter by location and client, as well as to change the time period.

- In this prototype emphasize the position of jobs in time and status.

### Research

The start of process consisted of retrieving and understanding the data from EPA's website.
