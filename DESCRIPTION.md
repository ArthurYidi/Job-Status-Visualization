### Summary

[Jyve](http://www.jyve.com/) is an application that faclitates merchandize inspection for food and bevarage industries. Clients which own big brands such as Gatorade want to make sure their product looks good and is well stocked on stores all over the country. Jyve provides an on-demand labor to fulfill the client's tasks.

During a period of three days I was assigned to come up with a prototype to allow clients and coordinators to view past and current tasks.

### Goal

- Provide a tool for administrators and coordinators to plan and manage tasks.

- Shows at a glance the “status” of the jobs in the system at a given period/window in time.

- Allow to filter by location and client, as well as to change the time period.

- In this prototype emphasize the position of jobs in time and status.

### Research

Early in the process I explored different existing solutions for keeping track of tasks. A good summary a different methods for planning tasks is provided below:

A timeline view such as the one below was the first direction for the prototype.

The next step would be to explore a [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board).
