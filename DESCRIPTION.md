### Goal

- Provide a tool for administrators and coordinators to plan and manage tasks.

- Shows at a glance the “status” of the jobs in the system at a given period/window in time.

- Allow to filter by location and client, as well as to change the time period.

- In this prototype emphasize the position of jobs in time and status.
